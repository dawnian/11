                <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
                <p>"A man, a plan, a coffee bean". Okay, that doesn't make a palindrome, but it resulted in a damn good
                    cup
                    of
                    coffee.
                    Starbuzz's CEO is that man, and you already know his plan: a Starbuzz on every corner.</p>
                <p>In only a few years he's executed that plan and today you can enjoy Starbuzz just about anywhere.
                    And, of
                    course, the
                    big news this year is that Starbuzz teamed up with Head First readers to create Starbuzz's Web
                    presence,
                    which is
                    growing rapidly and helping to meet the caffeine needs of a whole new set of customers.</p>
